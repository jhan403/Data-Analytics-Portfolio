# ML Pipeline README

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the machine learning pipeline, instructions on how to use the `requirements.txt` file, and how to run the `ml_pipeline.py` file.

## Code Explanation
The machine learning pipeline consists of several steps including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The main script is `ml_pipeline.py`, which orchestrates these steps.

### Files
- `ml_pipeline.py`: Main script to run the machine learning pipeline.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the pipeline.

### Key Functions in `ml_pipeline.py`
- `load_data()`: Function to load and preprocess the data.
- `train_model()`: Function to train the machine learning model.
- `evaluate_model()`: Function to evaluate the trained model.

## Using `requirements.txt`
The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary Python packages needed to run the pipeline. To install these dependencies, use the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Pipeline
To run the machine learning pipeline, execute the `ml_pipeline.py` script. Use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python path_to_pipeline/ml_pipeline.py
```

## Running the Pipeline with a new dataset

```sh
python path_to_pipeline\ml_pipeline.py --file path_to_new_data\benign_malignant_tumor.csv --batch path_to_new_data\benign_malignant_tumor.csv
```

Ensure that you have installed all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` before running the script.

## Conclusion
This README provides a brief overview of the machine learning pipeline, how to install dependencies, and how to run the main script. For more detailed information, refer to the comments and documentation within the code.
